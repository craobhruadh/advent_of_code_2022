# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions for this year's Advent of Code.  Designed to be run from this directory.  For example to run day one just call: 

`python solutions/day_01.py`


Goals: 
1. Get as far as one can (life happens)
1. Try and get a correct solution on the first try each time.  We will be using unit tests to further this goal.
